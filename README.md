## Welcome to My Homepage

  My name is Yuexin Wu, a senior majoring in computer science. I am currently persuing the bachelor's degree in Peking University, Beijing, China. I'm currently working in Bytedance as a back-end development intern in the department of PCDN. I used to research in the field of transaction fee mechanism on blockchains. If you are interested in me, please contact me through email. My email address is yuexin.wu@pku.edu.cn (optional: pkubetty2019@gmail.com).

### Education

* Computer Science, Bachelor's Degree (In Progress, 2019.09-now), Peking University
* Master of Internet Networking, Master's Degree (Incoming, 2023.09-2024.12), Carnegie Mellon University

### Research Experience

* I'm currently (2022.04-now) an intern in the Distributed and Automated Games And Managerial Economics (daGAME) Lab, which is leading by Prof.Xiaotie Deng. My research interest lies in transaction fee mechanism in blockchain. Now I'm doing research about non-myopic miners and users under the protocol called EIP-1559 especially.

* My last internship (2021.05-2021.11) was in the Network and Information Security Lab in the Wang Xuan Institute, directed by Dr.Xinhui Han. My research was relevant to vulnerabilities of Android Apps.

### Project Experience

* Compiler for C++: Developed a compiler that could compile C++ programs with variables and recurrent function calls 
* Central Difference Convolutional Network: Researched previous method for Face Anti-Spoofing. Trained a FAS consisting of a novel central difference convolutional network and multi-scale attention fusion module. Achieved accuracy of over 98\% on the OULU-NPU dataset
* Image Retrieval: devise the original mAP index loss function to the variable range, improve accuracy rate by at least 10\%
* Calculator: use verilog and FPGA to write programs that can be directly compiled into the circuit board for operation of arithmetic and display of number
* XV6 Operating System: implement a simple Unix operating system based on a course framework
* Image Inpainting: complete an image inpainting program with UI for interaction, the algorithm includes both traditional and deep learning versions for users to choose
* Classification of Chinese Ancient Poems: Classified the Chinese Ancient Poems using biLSTM and Attention network structure. Reached the accuracy rate of 50% with five slots for the program to allocate the poems
* RTP -- A Simple Reliable Transport Protocol: Developed a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)-like, reliable transport protocol based on UDP in the presence of packet loss, delay, corruption, duplication and reordering![image](https://github.com/BettyYuexin/BettyYuexin/assets/58321805/ce3b547c-6917-4d85-83da-62fc1d48b313)



### Leadership and Social Experience
* Vice Chairman of the Students' Union, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science: Hold balls for freshmen, competitions on programming and contact sponsers from Internet companies
* Volunteer(Olympic Family Assistant), Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games: Accompany and arrange schedules for the General Secretary of National Olympic Committee


### Skills
